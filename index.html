            had no desire to do what he could not do. It is different now.

        <p>
          I often overlook the blessings in my life because of a relentless
          focus on what I have not yet achieved. Or, put another way, I am not
          satisfied with the good things already in my life because other good
          things remain just out of reach. I ignore the success already achieved
          because I am not independently wealthy. I take my health for granted.
          I become preoccupied with public personalities.
        </p>

          But, when I consider that my life is constrained by the possibilities
          afforded by my creator, a gratefulness for my circumstances can grow.
          I am chosen to wear this face, be this gender and live in these times.
          I am a man of Northern European heritage, living in the United States,
          working as a Software Engineer, supporting three young children and
          supported in turn by my family and friends.

          When I let go of the good things I want, but which I lack any power to
          achieve, the goodness of my life becomes apparent. Each detail,
          initially perceived as a list of facts (age, ethnicity, etc.), is
          transformed into a litany of blessings. An authentic happiness
          develops and my heart is filled with joy, peace and, dare I say, a
          &ldquo;paradise&rdquo;.
